1. Build the documentation and put it here in a directory called "html".

2. Build the 64 bit clutter-gst client and put it here calling it "trickplay.amd64".
   Make sure you strip it.

3. Build the 32 bit clutter-gst client and put it here calling it "trickplay.i386".
   Make sure you strip it.

4. Edit "changelog" - updating the TrickPlay version and adding an entry.

5. Edit "build" and update the TrickPlay version. See if any dependencies have 
   been added or removed.

6. Run "build". It should spit out two .deb files. Lintian reports a problem with 
   the changelog format (which I have not been able to solve) and an issue with 
   zlib - which is because of the unzip source code.
