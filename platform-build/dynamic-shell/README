THESE FILES CAME FROM WONGI, BUT I MADE SOME CHANGES- AND SOME FIXES

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
In tp_main.c I do:
    tp_context_set(pContext, TP_CONFIG_FROM_FILE , "/mnt/usb2/Drive1/trickplay/config" );
This is to pick up Trickplay configuration information from that file. That path may need to be changed.

ON THE USB DRIVE YOU NEED THE FOLLOWING:

<usb>/trickplay/libtrickplay.so (produced by this makefile)
<usb>/trickplay/config (located here, but may need changes)
<usb>/trickplay/apps (any apps you want to run)



1. Makefile produces 'libtrickplay.so' at the current directory.

2. For successful build, you may change CROSS_COMPILE variable to the path of your toolchain located.

3. You can add or remove dependencies for modifying INCLUDE_MODULE variable of Makefile.

4. Header files at the include directory are the simplified copy of related LG DTV modules' header file.

5. Media playing functions are implemented but do not work.


[Issues]

- When includes libtpcore.a to the INCLUDE_MODULE, shows following message as a result of link. Target is created however.

	ld: BFD 2.17.50-brcm 20070220 assertion fail ../../binutils-2.17.50/bfd/elf-eh-frame.c:1070


-- FIXED - by adding environment G_SLICE=always_malloc in the correct place in tp_main.c
    - Aborted at runtime because of assertion failed condition related to Glib memory align.
    This is not happen when using Glib received with TrickPlay 0.0.6.

	    ***MEMORY-ERROR***: [453]: GSlice: assertion failed: aligned_memory == (gpointer) addr
