/**
 * The TVBrowser class automatically searches for possible TVs to connect to.
 * The TVs are represented by NSNetService objects. The TVBrowser's delegate
 * receives calls when TVs advertise their connection information over the
 * local network. Calling:
 * - (void)connectToService:(NSNetService *)service will tell the TVBrowser
 * to attempt to connect to the NSNetService object "service" provided that the
 * the service is broadcasted from a Trickplay enabled TV. If the connection is
 * established a TVConnection object is passed back to the delegate in a message,
 * else, the same NSNetService that the TVBrowser failed to connect to is passed to
 * the delegate.
 *
 * The TVBrowser automatically begins searching for TVs when initialized.
 *
 * The TVBrowser allows the owner to call - connectToService: multiple times
 * for multiple different connections. It is up to the owner to manage the 
 * TVConnection objects passed to the delegate. Releasing TVConnection objects
 * automatically disconnects the connection when - dealloc is called on
 * the TVConnection object.
 *
 * The owner of the TVBrowser may create a TVBrowserViewController which
 * provides an automatically updated UI for its host TVBrowser.
 * The TVBrowserViewController retains its TVBrowser, so the owner may release
 * the TVBrowser after creation. However, The caller to - getNewTVBrowserViewController
 * does not own the returned TVBrowserViewController; the caller must retain
 * the returned TVBrowserViewController if it is intended for long term use.
 *
 * When the TVBrowser is searching for TVs it may slow down all connected
 * TVConnection objects, thus slowing down communication between already established
 * connections to local TVs. Therefore, the owner should call
 * - (void)stopSearchForServices when the TVBrowser is not needed, in order to
 * not bog down any active connections.
