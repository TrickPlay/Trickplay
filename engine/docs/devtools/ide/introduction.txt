Title: TrickPlay IDE Introduction

The TrickPlay IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides editing and debugging capabilities that streamline the creation of a TrickPlay application.

The IDE Editor can be used to create a TrickPlay application's source files. The TrickPlay Visual Editor can be used to define the user interface and the generated project files can be loaded into the IDE Editor to run the application and add additional functionality.

A TrickPlay application is typically developed on a computer terminal, but the final application is intended to run on a television. The IDE can run a TrickPlay application in either of these configurations.

While running, the application can be tested and debugged by stepping through the code and monitoring variable values. The application can be stopped at any code statement by setting a breakpoint on the statement. Using the debugging capabilities, it's possible to see exactly what a program is doing and how variable values are affected. The debugger is especially effective in locating problems that exist deep within a program's logic where the use of print statements would be difficult.

Prerequisites:

To run the TrickPlay IDE, you should have completed the following steps.
- Installed the TrickPlay SDK
- Installed the Ubuntu packages listed below. These can be installed with the Ubuntu Software Center.

	(code)
	python-qt4
	python-qscintilla2
	(end)
	
The Python version must be v2.7 or later, but not Python 3.x. The PyQt version must be v4.7.2 or later.
	
Running the TrickPlay IDE:

To run from the command line: From any directory, enter the following command.

	(code)
	./start.py
	(end)

To run from a graphical user interface: In either the Applications->Developer Tools or Applications->Programming window (depending on the Linux graphic shell you are running), click on the "TrickPlay IDE" icon.
