Class: ProgressSpinner

The ProgressSpinner class provides an animated visual graphic indicating that an operation is in-progress. A ProgressSpinner is useful in situations where the length of time or amount of work required to complete the operation is indeterminate or difficult to calculate.

A ProgressSpinner supports various display characteristics, including several built-in styles with configurable size, color and animation speed.



Constructor: progressSpinner( properties )

The progressSpinner() constructor creates a new ProgressSpinner UI element object. Property settings can be set by the properties argument; default settings are used for any property not set explicitly.

*Prototype:*

	(code)
	ProgressSpinner progressSpinner( properties )
	(end)

*Argument:*

properties - table of ProgressSpinner property settings

The properties table contains a comma-separated list of property settings for the new ProgressSpinner. If a property is not explicitly set, its default value is used.

*Return Value:* Returns an object that contains the new ProgressSpinner and related support objects. The returned object should be used to access the ProgressSpinner's properties and functions.

*Example:* Create a new ProgressSpinner, specifying some properties

	(code)
	-- Load the UI Element library
	ui_element = dofile( "/lib/ui_element.lua" )

	-- Create a new ProgressSpinner, setting some of its ProgressSpinner-specific properties
	local progSpinner = ui_element.progressSpinner{ ui_position = { 100, 100, 0 },
                                                    style = "spinning",
                                                    overall_diameter = 50 }

	-- Set some of the ProgressSpinner's UIElement properties
	progSpinner.name = "FileLoadInProgress"
	progSpinner.opacity = 180
	(end)



Property: ui_position

The ui_position property is a table of integer values specifying the object's screen coordinates: X, Y and Z, respectively.

*Default Setting:* { 400, 400, 0 }



Property: style

The style property is a string specifying the spinner's display type.

*Supported Settings:* The style property is case-sensitive.

"orbitting" - the spinner is a series of dots revolving around a circle. Various additional characteristics can be defined, including the number of dots, their size, and the size of the revolving circle.
"spinning" - the spinner is a square revolving around its center.

*Default Setting:* "orbitting"

*See Also:* Nearly all the ProgressSpinner properties modify the display characteristics of the spinner.



Property: number_of_dots

The number_of_dots property is an integer value specifying the number of dots to include in the spinner.

The number_of_dots property is used only if the object's <style> property is "orbitting".

*Default Setting:* 12

*See Also:* the <style> and <dot_diameter> properties



Property: dot_color

The dot_color property is a table of integer RGB (Red/Green/Blue) and alpha(transparent/opaque) settings specifying the color of the spinner's graphic.

The format of the RGB and alpha settings is described in <RGB/Alpha Color Formats>.

If the object's <skin> property is set to "CarbonCandy", the dot_color property is not used.

*Default Setting:* { 255, 255, 255, 255 } (white and completely opaque)

*See Also:* the <style> property



Property: dot_diameter

The dot_diameter property is an integer value specifying the size in pixels of the spinner's individual dots.

The dot_diameter property is used only if the object's <style> property is "orbitting".

*Default Setting:* 10

*See Also:* the <style> and <overall_diameter> properties



Property: overall_diameter

The overall_diameter property is an integer value specifying the total size in pixels of the spinner's graphic. For object's with a <style> setting of "orbitting", the overall_diameter specifies the size of the circle the dots revolve around. If the style is set to "spinning", the overall_diameter indicates the width/height of the spinning square.

*Default Setting:* 100

*See Also:* the <style> property



Property: cycle_time

The cycle_time property is an integer value specifying the number of milliseconds required for the spinner's graphic to perform one revolution.

*Default Setting:* 1800, i.e., a little less than 2 seconds (1 second = 1000 milliseconds)

*See Also:* the <style> property



Property: skin

The skin property is a string specifying the display appearance of the ProgressSpinner. This functionality is under active development.

*Supported Settings:* The skin property is case-sensitive.

"default" - a utilitarian and sedate skin
"CarbonCandy" - an alternative skin. Flashy, attracts attention

*Default Setting:* "default"



Function: speed_up

The speed_up() function decreases the <cycle_time> property by 50 milliseconds, thereby increasing the speed of the spinner by 1/20th of a second. Note: It is also possible to set the cycle_time property directly to any desired value.

*Prototype:* speed_up()

*Arguments:* None

*Return Value:* None

*See Also:* the <speed_down> function and the <cycle_time> property



Function: speed_down

The speed_down() function increases the <cycle_time> property by 50 milliseconds, thereby decreasing the speed of the spinner by 1/20th of a second. Note: It is also possible to set the cycle_time property directly to any desired value.

*Prototype:* speed_down()

*Arguments:* None

*Return Value:* None

*See Also:* the <speed_up> function and the <cycle_time> property
