Class: Button

A Button is a standard user interface button. In addition to Button-specific properties, Buttons also provide all the properties, events, and functions implemented by the TrickPlay Runtime Engine's <UIElement> interface.



Constructor: button( properties )

The button() function creates a new Button UI Element. Property settings can be set by the properties argument; default settings are used for any property not set explicitly.

*Argument:*

properties - table of Button property settings

The properties table contains a comma-separated list of property settings for the new Button. If a property is not explicitly set, its default value is used.

*Return Value:* Returns a Group object that contains the new Button

*Example:* Create a new button, specifying some properties

(code)
-- Create all the UI Elements
ui_element = dofile( "/lib/ui_element.lua" )

-- Create a new button, setting some of its Button-specific properties
local myButton = ui_element.button{ label = "myButton", ui_width = 400 }

-- Set some of the button's UIElement properties
myButton.name = "myButton"
myButton.position = { 700, 300, 0 }
(end)



Property: ui_width 

The ui_width property is an integer value specifying the button's width in pixels.

*Default Setting:* 180

*See Also:* the <ui_height> property



Property: ui_height

The ui_height property is an integer specifying the button's height in pixels.

*Default Setting:* 60

*See Also:* the <ui_width> property



Property: ui_position

The ui_position property is a table of integer values specifying the object's screen coordinates: X, Y and Z, respectively.

*Default Setting:* { 100, 100, 0 }

*See Also:* the <ui_width> and <ui_height> properties



Property: label

The label property is a string to display within the button.

*Default Setting:* "Button"

*See Also:* the <text_font> and the <text_color> properties



Property: text_font

The text_font property is a string specifying the Button's font. The font string's format is described in the <Text.font> section.

*Default Setting:* "DejaVu Sans 30px"

*See Also:* the <label> and <text_color> properties



Property: text_color 

The text_color property is a table of integer RGB (Red/Green/Blue) and alpha(transparent/opaque) settings. The format of the RGB and alpha settings is described in <RGB/Alpha Color Formats>.

*Default Setting:* {255, 255, 255, 255} (white and completely opaque)

*See Also:* the <label>, <text_font> and <focus_text_color> properties



Property: focus_text_color

The focus_text_color property is a table of integer RGB and alpha settings specifying the button's text color when it has input focus. The format of the RGB and alpha settings is described in <RGB/Alpha Color Formats>.

*Default Setting:* {255, 255, 255, 255} (white and completely opaque)

*See Also:* the <text_color> property



Property: text_has_shadow

The text_has_shadow property is a boolean value indicating whether or not the button text displays a shadow (true=has shadow).

*Default Setting:* true



Property: skin

The skin property is a string specifying the button's skin. The skin functionality is under active development.

*Default Setting:* "default"



Property: fill_color

The fill_color property is a table of integer RGB and alpha settings specifying the button's fill color. The format of the RGB and alpha settings is described in <RGB/Alpha Color Formats>.

*Default Setting:* { 255, 255, 255, 0 } (white and transparent)

*See Also:* the <focus_fill_color> and <border_color> properties



Property: focus_fill_color

The focus_fill_color property is a table of integer RGB and alpha settings specifying the button's fill color when it has focus. The format of the RGB and alpha settings is described in <RGB/Alpha Color Formats>.

*Default Setting:* {27, 145, 27, 0}

*See Also:* the <fill_color> property



Property: border_width

The border_width property is an integer specifying button's border width in pixels.

*Default Setting:* 1

*See Also:* the <border_corner_radius> and <border_color> properties



Property: border_corner_radius

The border_corner_radius property is an integer specifying the radius in pixels of each of the button's four corners.

A radius of 0 will produce square, 90-degree corners. As values increase, the corners become more rounded. To produce a button with a completely rounded left and right side, set the border_corner_radius property to a value of ui_height / 2. To create a circular button, set the button's ui_width and ui_height to identical values, and set the border_corner_radius property to ui_height (or ui_width) / 2.

*Default Setting:* 12

*See Also:* the <ui_width> and <ui_height> properties



Property: border_color

The border_color property is a table of integer RGB and alpha settings specifying the button's border color. The format of the RGB and alpha settings is described in <RGB/Alpha Color Formats>.

The border's color when the button has key focus is specified in the <focus_color> property.

*Default Setting:* {255, 255, 255, 255} (white and opaque)

*See Also:* the <focus_border_color> and <fill_color> properties



Property: focus_border_color

The focus_border_color is a table of integer RGB and alpha settings specifying the button's border color when it has focus. The format of the RGB and alpha settings is described in <RGB/Alpha Color Formats>.

*Default Setting:* {27, 145, 27, 255}

*See Also:* the <border_color> property



Function: set_focus

The set_focus() function forces the key focus to the button.

Calling set_focus() also causes the <on_focus> event handler to be called.

If the function's key argument is set to keys.Return then the button's <on_press> event handler is also called.

*Prototype:* set_focus( key )

*Arguments:*

key - Optional argument. If equal to keys.Return, the on_press() event handler is called. Other values have no effect.

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <on_focus> and <on_press> event handlers



Function: clear_focus

The clear_focus() function releases the key focus from the button.

Calling clear_focus() also causes the <on_unfocus> event handler to be called.

After calling clear_focus(), no screen element has the input focus.

*Prototype:* clear_focus()

*Arguments:* None.

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <on_unfocus> event handler



Event Handler: on_focus

The on_focus() event handler is called whenever the button receives the key focus.

The TrickPlay Visual Editor generates an empty skeleton on_focus() event handler in the project's main.lua file for every button it creates. Add your own code to this skeleton handler to implement the operations that should be performed when the button receives the key focus.

*Default Setting:* nil or references an empty skeleton handler, i.e., focus-in events are ignored.

*See Also:* the <set_focus> function and the <on_unfocus> event handler



Event Handler: on_unfocus

The on_unfocus() event handler is called whenever the button loses the key focus.

The TrickPlay Visual Editor generates an empty skeleton on_unfocus() event handler in the project's main.lua file for every button it creates. Add your own code to this skeleton handler to implement the operations that should be performed when the button loses the key focus.

*Default Setting:* nil or references an empty skeleton handler, i.e., focus-out events are ignored.

*See Also:* the <clear_focus> function and the <on_focus> event handler



Event Handler: on_press

The on_press() event handler is called whenever the button is pressed.

The TrickPlay Visual Editor generates an empty skeleton on_press() event handler in the project's main.lua file for every button it creates. Add your own code to this skeleton handler to implement the operations that should be performed when the button is pressed.

*Default Setting:* nil or references an empty skeleton handler, i.e., button-press events are ignored.

*Example:* When button is pressed, transition to another screen

(code)
-- Assume we have two screens: FirstScreen and NextScreen.
-- We are currently in the FirstScreen, which contains a button with its name property set to "GoToNextScreen".
-- When the GoToNextScreen button is pressed, its on_press() event handler below is called.

-- The TrickPlay Visual Editor automatically generates the handler skeleton and saves it in the
-- project's main.lua file. You can also write the handler definition yourself if you don't use the Editor.
layout["FirstScreen"].GoToNextScreen.on_press = function() -- Handler for GoToNextScreen.on_press in this screen
  -- We add this code...
  -- Transition to NextScreen using a fade-out/fade-in effect
  ui_element.transit_to( groups["FirstScreen"], groups["NextScreen"], "fade" )
end


(end)
