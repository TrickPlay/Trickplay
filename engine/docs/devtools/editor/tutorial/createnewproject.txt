Topic: Create a New Project

Run the Visual Editor. If this is the first time the Editor has run, the New Project window displays.

If the Editor has been run before, the Editor automatically opens the project you were last working on. If this is the case and the New Project window is not shown, click on the File menu and select the New Project... item to display the New Project window.

In the Project Name field, enter Tutorial, then click the OK button. A new project is created and an empty Editor workspace is displayed.

When a new project is created, the Editor creates a new subdirectory using the project's name. This project directory is created in the ~/trickplay-editor directory. For example, the project directory for our new Tutorial project is ~/trickplay-editor/Tutorial. All subsequent files associated with this project will be stored in this project directory.

The Editor informs us of the project we are working on by displaying the project's name in the upper-right area of the Editor's menu. Later, after we save the screen that we will soon develop, this menu area will specify both the project name and the screen name.
