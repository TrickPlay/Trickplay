Topic: Visual Editor Tutorial

Introduction:

This tutorial will walk through the creation of a non-trivial application using the TrickPlay Visual Editor. The application will enable the user to configure an imaginary television set. The user will be able to specify a display language, select an operation mode, and assign other typical television settings. Over the course of creating this application, many of the Editor's capabilities will be demonstrated.

Prerequisites:

To walk through this tutorial, you should have completed the following steps.
- Installed the TrickPlay SDK

After installing the TrickPlay SDK, the Visual Editor can be run from either the command line or from a graphical interface.

To run from the command line:

From any directory, enter the following command.

	(code)
	trickplay-editor
	(end)

To run from a graphical user interface:

In the Applications->Developer Tools window, click on the "TrickPlay Visual Editor" icon.

(see images/VisualEditorIcon.png)

The first time the Visual Editor is run, it creates a subdirectory in your home directory called trickplay-editor. The ~/trickplay-editor directory stores all the project files, screen files, and other files created during the running of the Editor.
