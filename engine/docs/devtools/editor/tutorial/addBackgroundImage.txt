From here, you can select the desired background image. A sample background image to use in this tutorial has been provided in the file background.jpg. Select the file by clicking on it and then pressing the OK button.

3. The selected image will display within the Editor workspace. If necessary, click on the image to select it. When a UI element is selected, it is highlighted within a bounding red box. Right-click the selected image to display the image's Inspector dialog.

The Inspector dialog lists the various properties of the image object, such as its name and location within the Editor workspace. Set the background image's name to "ImageBackground." Object names may include any alpha-numeric characters, plus the underscore character.

The X and Y values specify the image's upper left position within the Editor workspace. The upper left corner of the Editor workspace is located at (X,Y) coordinate (0,0). The Editor workspace has a width of 1920 pixels and a height of 1080 pixels. Set the background image's X and Y values to 0 so that it is positioned at the workspace's top left corner.

Press the Apply button to apply the modified property settings.
