Title: TrickPlay Development Tools Overview

The TrickPlay SDK provides powerful tools that assist in the rapid development of a TrickPlay application.

The TrickPlay IDE is a complete development environment that includes a full-featured Editor and powerful Debugger. With the IDE, a TrickPlay application can be developed, run, tested and debugged from either a local computer terminal or a remote television.

A TrickPlay application's user interface can be created quickly by using the Visual Editor to position screen elements, like pushbuttons and edit boxes.

The Stitcher program combines several images into a single file. It also creates a JSON map file so the combined image file can be used to construct a <SpriteSheet> object.
