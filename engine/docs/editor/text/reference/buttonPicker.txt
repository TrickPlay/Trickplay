Class: ButtonPicker

A ButtonPicker enables the user to make a selection by scrolling through a list of available settings. Scrolling direction can be either horizontal or vertical. Items in the list can be added and removed dynamically.



Constructor: buttonPicker( properties )

The buttonPicker() function creates a new ButtonPicker UI element. Property settings can be set by the properties argument; default settings are used for any property not set explicitly.

*Prototype:*

	(code)
	bpGroup buttonPicker( properties )
	(end)

*Argument:*

properties - table of ButtonPicker property settings

The properties table contains a comma-separated list of property settings for the new ButtonPicker. If a property is not explicitly set, its default value is used.

*Return Value:* Returns a Group object that contains the new ButtonPicker and related support objects. The Group object should be used to access the ButtonPicker's properties and functions.

*Example:* Create a new ButtonPicker, specifying some properties

(code)
-- Load the UI Elements library
ui_element = dofile( "/lib/ui_element.lua" )

-- Create a new ButtonPicker, setting some of its ButtonPicker-specific properties
local colorPicker = ui_element.buttonPicker{ items = { "Red", "Green", "Blue", "B&W" },
                                             direction = "vertical",
                                             ui_width = 400 }

-- Set some of the buttonPicker's UIElement properties
colorPicker.name = "ColorPicker"
colorPicker.position = { 700, 500, 0 }

-- Add a color to the scrollable list
colorPicker:insertItem( "Yellow" )
(end)



Property: ui_width

The ui_width property is an integer value specifying the ButtonPicker's width in pixels.

*Default Setting:* 180

*See Also:* the <ui_height> property



Property: ui_height

The ui_height property is an integer specifying the ButtonPicker's height in pixels.

*Default Setting:* 60

*See Also:* the <ui_width> property



Property: ui_position

The ui_position property is a table of integer values specifying the object's screen coordinates: X, Y and Z, respectively.

*Default Setting:* { 300, 300, 0 }

*See Also:* the <ui_width> and <ui_height> properties



Property: items

The items property is a table of strings where each string specifies one item in the ButtonPicker's scrollable list.

*Default Setting:* { "item1", "item2", "item3" }

*See Also:* the <selected_item> and <direction> properties



Property: selected_item

The selected_item property is the integer index into the items table for the currently-selected item. The first item in the items list is at index 1.

You can set the selected_item property to initialize the starting item in the list or to force a particular item to be the current item. Setting the selected_item property does not cause the displayed list to automatically scroll to the designated item; the list must be scrolled programmatically to the modified item. Refer to the code example below for a demonstration.

You can retrieve the selected_item property to determine which item has been selected/is current.

*Default Setting:* 1

*Code Example:* Programmatically jump to a particular item in the scrollable list

(code)
-- Load the UI Element library
ui_element = dofile("/lib/ui_element.lua")

-- Create a ButtonPicker, defining its scrollable list and other settings
local bpNumbers = ui_element.buttonPicker{
		items = { "un", "deux", "trois", "quatre", "cinq", "six", "sept", "huit", "neuf", "dix" }
		}
bpNumbers.position = { 300, 350, 0 }

-- Create a Button, when pressed, it will jump to the 5th item in the list ("cinq")
local bJumpToCinq = ui_element.button{ ui_width = 300,
                                       label = "Jump to Cinq",
                                     }
bJumpToCinq.position = { 240, 550, 0 }

-- bJumpToCinq button-pressed event handler
bJumpToCinq.pressed = function()
	-- Jump to "cinq", the 5th item in the list
	-- Note: At this point, the current selected_item may be anywhere in the list.
	
	-- Variable definitions
	local curr      = bpNumbers.selected_item
	local num_items = #bpNumbers.items
	local desired   = 5
	local num_scrolls_back, num_scrolls_forward
	
	-- Validate value of desired and verify we're not already at the desired item
	if desired < 1 or desired > num_items or desired == curr then return end

	-- Find the shortest scrolling path (backward or forward) to the 5th item	
	-- Is current item past the desired item?
	if curr > desired then
		-- Yes, determine the number of scrolls in each direction to get to desired item
		num_scrolls_back = curr - desired
		num_scrolls_forward = num_items - curr + desired
	else
		-- No, current item is before desired, determine number of scrolls needed
		num_scrolls_back = curr + num_items - desired
		num_scrolls_forward = desired - curr
	end
	
	-- Which direction is shorter?
	if num_scrolls_back < num_scrolls_forward then
		-- Scroll back
		for i = 1, num_scrolls_back, 1 do
			-- Note: These scroll operations occur asynchronously with immediate
			-- termination of any existing unfinished operation. Because of this,
			-- all the scrolling ops, except the last one, may be aborted and not
			-- be viewable onscreen.
			bpNumbers:press_left()
		end
	else
		-- Scroll forward
		for i = 1, num_scrolls_forward, 1 do
			bpNumbers:press_right()
		end
	end
end
(end)

Predefined skins are provided, and the developer may define a custom skin. The following skin appearances are supported.

*Supported Settings:* The skin property is case-sensitive.

"default" - a utilitarian and sedate skin
"CarbonCandy" - an alternative skin. Flashy, attracts attention
"custom" - the skin is defined by the developer

When the "custom" skin is selected, the developer must define the <text_color>, <fill_color> and <border_color> properties of the ButtonPicker object for its focused and unfocused states.

*Default Setting:* "default"

*See Also:* the <text_color>, <fill_color> and <border_color> properties



Property: rotate_func

The rotate_func property is a reference to a function that is invoked after the ButtonPicker has scrolled to a new item in its list by a call to either the <press_left>, <press_right>, <press_up> or <press_down> function. Based upon the list's current item, the program can perform appropriate operations, such as displaying or hiding display elements.

Note: Setting the ButtonPicker's <selected_item> property does *not* cause the rotate_func function to be called.

The scrolling operation occurs asynchronously. If a second scrolling operation is invoked before the first scroll operation has finished, the first operation jumps immediately to its final state, which includes invoking the rotate_func. Thus, the rotate_func is guaranteed to be called, even if the scrolling operation is aborted early.

*Prototype:* rotate_func( current_item_index )

*Argument:*

current_item_index - integer index referencing the current item in the ButtonPicker's items property. The first item in the items list is at index 1.

*Return Value:* None.

*Default Setting:* nil

*See Also:* the <items> property



Function: insert_item

The insert_item() function adds an item to the end of the scrollable list contained in the ButtonPicker's items property.

*Prototype:* insert_item( item )

*Argument:*

item - the item to add to the list.

Typically, the item argument is a string, but it can be any type of data that you wish, including a table. Note, however, that a table gets added to the list as a single table item; the items in the table are not added as separate entries. For example, if you insert a table that contains three strings, the last item in the list will be the single table element; the three strings are not directly added to the list and will not be displayed as the list is scrolled. This is the case, even if the table contains only a single string.

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <items> property



Function: remove_item

The remove_item() function removes the last item from the scrollable list contained in the ButtonPicker's items property.

*Prototype:* remove_item()

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <items> property



Function: press_left

The press_left() function causes the ButtonPicker's scrollable list to scroll to the previous item in the list. The setting of the ButtonPicker's direction property has no effect on this function; even with a vertically-scrolling list, a call to press_left() moves to the list's previous item.

The press_up() function can be called to perform the same operation; the two functions are identical.

The scrolling operation occurs asynchronously. If a second scrolling operation is invoked before the first operation has finished, the first operation jumps immediately to its final state, and the second scrolling operation begins.



*Prototype:* press_left()

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <items> property, the <press_up> and <press_right> functions



Function: press_right

The press_right() function causes the ButtonPicker's scrollable list to scroll to the next item in the list. The setting of the ButtonPicker's direction property has no effect on this function; even with a vertically-scrolling list, a call to press_right() moves to the list's next item.

The press_down() function can be called to perform the same operation; the two functions are identical.

The scrolling operation occurs asynchronously. If a second scrolling operation is invoked before the first operation has finished, the first operation jumps immediately to its final state, and the second scrolling operation begins.



*Prototype:* press_right()

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <items> property, the <press_down> and <press_left> functions



Function: press_up

The press_up() function causes the ButtonPicker's scrollable list to scroll to the previous item in the list. The setting of the ButtonPicker's direction property has no effect on this function; even with a horizontally-scrolling list, a call to press_up() moves to the list's previous item.

The press_left() function can be called to perform the same operation; the two functions are identical.

The scrolling operation occurs asynchronously. If a second scrolling operation is invoked before the first operation has finished, the first operation jumps immediately to its final state, and the second scrolling operation begins.



*Prototype:* press_up()

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <items> property, the <press_left> and <press_down> functions



Function: press_down

The press_down() function causes the ButtonPicker's scrollable list to scroll to the next item in the list. The setting of the ButtonPicker's direction property has no effect on this function; even with a horizontally-scrolling list, a call to press_down() moves to the list's next item.

The press_right() function can be called to perform the same operation; the two functions are identical.

The scrolling operation occurs asynchronously. If a second scrolling operation is invoked before the first operation has finished, the first operation jumps immediately to its final state, and the second scrolling operation begins.



*Prototype:* press_down()

*Return Value:* None.

*See Also:* the <items> property, the <press_right> and <press_up> functions



Function: on_focus_in

The on_focus_in() function forces the input focus to the ButtonPicker.

*Prototype:* on_focus_in()

*Return Value:* None.



Function: on_focus_out

The on_focus_out() function releases the input focus from the ButtonPicker.

After calling on_focus_out(), no UI element has the input focus.

*Prototype:* on_focus_out()

*Arguments:* None.

*Return Value:* None.
