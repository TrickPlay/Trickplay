Topic: Create a New Project

Run the SDK Visual Editor. The New Project window displays.

(see images/EdNewProject.png)

In the New Project field, enter Tutorial, then click the Open button. A new project is created and an empty Editor workspace is displayed.

When a new project is created, the Editor creates a new subdirectory using the project's name. This project directory is created in the ~/trickplay-editor directory. For example, the project directory for our new Tutorial project is ~/trickplay-editor/Tutorial. All subsequent files associated with this project will be stored in this project directory.

The Editor informs us of the project we are working on by displaying the project's name in the upper-right area of the Editor's menu. Later, after we save the screen that we will soon develop, this menu area will specify both the project name and the screen name.
