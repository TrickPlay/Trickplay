Topic: Add Button Group

Our demonstration program will have the user select a desired language by clicking an appropriate button. First we'll define the buttons, then we'll arrange and align them into a clean design, and finally, we'll define focus navigation routes so users can use the keyboard to move to the desired button.

1. Define the Buttons

2. Align the Buttons

3. Define Focus Navigation
