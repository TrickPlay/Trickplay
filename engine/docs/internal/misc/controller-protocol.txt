        TU <finger> <x> <y>

    Advanced UI connection (Added in v3.4)
        UX <controller id>

            This message tells the server that this connection will, from
            this point forward, be used to exchange advanced UI messages
            synchronously. The server will stop reading from this connection,
            until it writes a UX message.

            The <controller id> was received by the controller in the WM message.

            The controller should create a new connection to the server and send
            this message as the initial message, instead of ID. Then, it should not
            write anything else, but begin an asynchronous read.

            When the controller reads a complete UX message from the server, it should
            process it and write a reply synchronously. Then, it should start another
            asynchronous read - waiting for the next message.


    Streaming Video (Added in v4.5)
        SVCC <address>
            This message tells the server that the requested call has connected.  Great news
            everyone!  The RTP packets are flowing again!  The address is the address that was
            connected to.

        SVCF <address> <reason>
            This message tells the server that the requested call failed to connect for some reason.
            The address that was attempted is returned, along with a string which describes as well
            as possible the failure condition.  This message should be sent instead of SVCC.  If
            SVCC has been sent, then the controller should use SVCD instead to indicate subsequent
            failure before SVCE.

        SVCD <address> <reason>
            This message tells the server that the call which was in-progress has been dropped (ie
            disconnected unexpectedly).  The message includes the address that was connected, and
            a string which describes as well as possible the failure condition.  This message should
            be used instead of SVCF after the SVCC message has been sent and before SVCE.

        SVCE <address> <who>
            This message tells the server that the call was intentionally ended by either the caller
            or the callee.  The address of the callee is passed in <address>, and <who> specifies
            which side ended the call.  If the caller (ie the controller) ended the call, then <who>
            should be "CALLER".  If the callee ended the call, then <who> should be "CALLEE".  If
            the server initiates a hangup using SVEC, then <who> should be "CALLER".

        SVCS <status> <address>
            This message notifies the server of the current streaming video status.  Possible
            values of <status> are:

            "READY"         -- <address> should be "" and the controller is ready to make calls
            "CONNECTED"     -- controller is currently streaming video to <address>
            "WAIT"          -- <address> should be "" and the controller is not ready to make calls

            This message may be sent at any time by the controller to notify the server of status
            changes, and MUST be sent by the controller in response to a SVSS request from the server

                    http://<host>:<port>/<address>

                a string that groups this resource with others.

    Welcome
        WM <version> <http port>  (Added in v3.1)
        WM <version> <http port>  <controller id> (Changed in in v3.4)

            This message is sent to the controller right after the server
            receives its ID message.

            <version>

                An integer denoting the protocol version the server supports. This will
                always have at least two digits. The last digit is the minor version, which
                will never be more than 9. So, for version 3.0, this will be '30'. For version
                3.1, this will be '31'. For version 10.0, this will be '100'.

            <http port>

                The port for HTTP requests. This should be used to fetch resources and submit
                pictures or audio clips.

            <controller id> (Added in v3.4)

                An unsigned integer that uniquely identifies this controller on the server.

    Submit picture
        PI <path> (Added in v3.1)
        PI <path> <max width> <max height> <edit> <mask resource> (Changed in v3.3)

            This message asks the controller to send a picture. Path is the part portion
            of a URI that should use the same host as the controller connection and the
            HTTP port received in the WM message. The controller should let the user
            choose a picture or take one and then send it to the server using an HTTP
            POST to the path.

            <max width> and <max height> are unsigned integers. If they are not zero, the
            picture should be scaled to the maximums given before it is sent. Either one, neither
            or both could be zero.
            <edit> is a boolean (0 or 1). If 1, the controller should give the user a chance
            to edit the picture before it is sent.
            <mask resource> is a string that can be empty. If it is not empty, it is the name
            of a resource (given with DR). The controller should composite the picture with
            the mask before it submits it.

    Submit audio clip
        AC <path> (Added in v3.1)

            This message asks the controller to send an audio clip. Path is the part portion
            of a URI that should use the same host as the controller connection and the
            HTTP port received in the WM message. The controller should let the user
            record a short clip and then send it to the server using an HTTP POST to the
            path.

    Advanced UI

        UX <command> <JSON array> (Added in v3.2)

            <command> is one of "CREATE" "DESTROY" "SET" "GET"

            <Description>

    Show Virtual Remote (Added in 4.2)

        SV

    Hide Virtual Remote (Added in 4.2)

        HV

    Streaming Video (Added in 4.5)

        SVSC <address>
            This message asks the controller to initiate a SIP call to <address>

        SVEC <address>
            This message asks the controller to end a call in progress to <address>, or to abort
            the calling sequence if the call is not yet connected.

        SVSS
            This message asks the controller to send a SVCS event as soon as possible to indicate
            the state of the streaming video system
