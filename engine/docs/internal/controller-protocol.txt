        Type is one of the following:
        
            ET - for enter text
            MC - for multiple choice
            CI - for cancel image (in this case, the text parameter can be omitted)
            CA - for cancel audio (in this case, the text parameter can be omitted)
            UX - for advanced UI events. <text> is a JSON string. (Added in 4.1)

    Advanced UI connection (Added in v3.4)
        UX <controller id>
        
            This message tells the server that this connection will, from
            this point forward, be used to exchange advanced UI messages
            synchronously. The server will stop reading from this connection, 
            until it writes a UX message.    
            
            The <controller id> was received by the controller in the WM message.
    
            The controller should create a new connection to the server and send
            this message as the initial message, instead of ID. Then, it should not
            write anything else, but begin an asynchronous read. 
            
            When the controller reads a complete UX message from the server, it should
            process it and write a reply synchronously. Then, it should start another
            asynchronous read - waiting for the next message.

                string. Either a uri with an http: or https: scheme or
                anything else: get from host,port of controller with uri:
                    http://<host>:<port>/<address>

    Welcome 
        WM <version> <http port>  (Added in v3.1)
        WM <version> <http port>  <controller id> (Changed in in v3.4)
        
            This message is sent to the controller right after the server
            receives its ID message. 
            
            <version> 
            
                An integer denoting the protocol version the server supports. This will
                always have at least two digits. The last digit is the minor version, which 
                will never be more than 9. So, for version 3.0, this will be '30'. For version
                3.1, this will be '31'. For version 10.0, this will be '100'.
            
            <http port> 
            
                The port for HTTP requests. This should be used to fetch resources and submit
                pictures or audio clips.
                
            <controller id> (Added in v3.4)
            
                An unsigned integer that uniquely identifies this controller on the server.
            
    Submit picture
        PI <path> (Added in v3.1)
        PI <path> <max width> <max height> <edit> <mask resource> (Changed in v3.3)
        
            This message asks the controller to send a picture. Path is the part portion
            of a URI that should use the same host as the controller connection and the
            HTTP port received in the WM message. The controller should let the user 
            choose a picture or take one and then send it to the server using an HTTP 
            POST to the path.
            
            <max width> and <max height> are unsigned integers. If they are not zero, the
            picture should be scaled to the maximums given before it is sent. Either one, neither
            or both could be zero.
            <edit> is a boolean (0 or 1). If 1, the controller should give the user a chance
            to edit the picture before it is sent.
            <mask resource> is a string that can be empty. If it is not empty, it is the name
            of a resource (given with DR). The controller should composite the picture with
            the mask before it submits it.
            
    Submit audio clip            
        AC <path> (Added in v3.1)
        
            This message asks the controller to send an audio clip. Path is the part portion
            of a URI that should use the same host as the controller connection and the
            HTTP port received in the WM message. The controller should let the user
            record a short clip and then send it to the server using an HTTP POST to the
            path.
        
    Advanced UI
