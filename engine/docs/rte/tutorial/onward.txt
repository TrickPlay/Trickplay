Topic: Onward and Outward

The Tutorial application is now complete.

At this point, you have a good foundation for creating your own TrickPlay applications. To build upon this foundation further, you can browse through the <TrickPlay SDK Engine Reference> which contains detailed information about all the classes, properties and functions provided by the TrickPlay SDK libraries. Good starting points in the Reference would be the <Animation Overview> and <User Interface Overview> sections. You can also learn about advanced animation classes by looking at the <Animator Sample Application> and the <AnimationState Sample Application>.

Good luck.
