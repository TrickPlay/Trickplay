Topic: Create the Main Window

A TrickPlay application can have one or more display windows with multiple items shown in each window. The TrickPlay SDK libraries include a global variable called <screen> that organizes all the application's windows and their contents. The screen variable is basically a container that holds all of an application's display items, including windows and other displayed objects, such as images and user-interface elements. Before an object can be shown on the display, it first must be added to the screen container variable. Also, the screen itself must be shown.

When a TrickPlay application starts, the screen container variable is empty. Although it's empty, the screen can still be shown by calling the variable's show() function, as in the code statement below.

	(code)
	-- Show the display
	screen:show()
	(end)
	
Open the tutorial's main.lua file and add the code statement shown above to display the empty screen. Save the file and run the application. An empty display window will open.

(see images/emptyScreen.png)

The screen has a fixed size of 1920x1080 pixels. The fixed size is scaled automatically, however, to fit the actual display dimensions.

The application and TrickPlay Engine can both be terminated by either entering /exit in the Engine console's command prompt or by clicking the display window's Close icon.

As you can see, an empty screen is solid black. Let's liven it up by adding a colored background.
