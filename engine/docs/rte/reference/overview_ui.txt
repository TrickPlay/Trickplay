Title: User Interface Overview

The TrickPlay SDK provides various classes and variables to present information on a screen display.

Each item shown on the display must be added to the global <screen> variable.

The <Text> class enables the creation of string labels and text input fields and supports many configurable properties, including display settings, such as font usage, color, spacing and alignment.

The <Rectangle> class provides a useful mechanism for laying out sections of the display.

Existing <Image> files, such as company logos and other graphic assets, can be positioned easily anywhere on the display.

Complex vector-based graphics can be created programmatically using the <Canvas> and <Bitmap> classes.

All these items can be combined together into a conceptual <Group> and subsequent manipulations can then be performed upon the group in a single efficient operation, rather than multiple times upon each item.

In addition, the TrickPlay Visual Editor provides a large number of user interface elements, including buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and much more. Information about the Visual Editor can be found at <file:../../devtools/editor/introduction-txt.html>.
