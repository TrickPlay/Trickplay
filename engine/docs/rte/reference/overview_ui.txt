Title: User Interface Overview

The TrickPlay SDK provides various classes to present information on the display and to accept user input. Additional user interface items are provided in the TrickPlay Visual Editor at <file:../../devtools/editor/introduction-txt.html>.

The global <screen> variable contains all the display's user-interface elements, such as text, buttons, checkboxes and images. A program can also produce complex vector graphics by using the <Canvas> class.

Most of the foundational capabilities of the user interface components are defined in the <UIElement> class. Also supported is the ability to combine multiple elements into a single <Group>, which enables modifications to all the elements by manipulating only the single Group item.
