Title: System Information Overview

A TrickPlay application can access information about itself, as well as the TrickPlay Engine. Information related to the application is stored in the <app> global variable, while the <trickplay> variable contains information about the TrickPlay Engine. In non-production versions of the TrickPlay SDK, the <devtools> global variable provides utility functions and information about internal Engine data structures.
