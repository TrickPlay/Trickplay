Title: Widget Library

The TrickPlay SDK provides a library of Lua widgets, such as Button and CheckBox, that enables and simplifies the creation of sophisticated user interfaces.

To use the Widget Library, all the files stored in the libraries/ui directory, including the contents of all the subdirectories, must be copied into the TrickPlay application's app bundle. For example, the following commands entered on the Linux command line will create a new subdirectory called widgetlib and copy the Widget Library files into it. Note: The exact file locations will differ for other computers.

	(code)
	cd ~/myApp
	mkdir widgetlib
	cp -r ~/trickplay/libraries/ui/* ./widgetlib/
	(end)

Before constructing the first widget, the TrickPlay application must load the Widget Library by calling the Lua <dofile> function. The function's return value should be saved in a variable and used as a prefix in subsequent calls to the library. The example code statements below demonstrate how to load the Widget Library and create a Button widget.

	(code)
	-- Load the Widget Library. This is necessary before creating the first widget.
	-- Save the function's return value for subsequent calls to the library.
	WL = dofile( "widgetlib/Widget_Library" )

	-- Create a Button object
	button = WL.Button( { position = { 100, 100 },
	                      label    = "My First Widget",
	} )
	(end)
