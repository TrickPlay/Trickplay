Title: Timers Overview

The TrickPlay SDK library supports several types of timers. The <Timer> class enables a user-defined event to be fired after a specified amount of time has elapsed. The <Stopwatch> class measures elapsed time. The <idle> global variable supports a user-defined event that is fired as often as possible when the system is otherwise idle.
