Title: Utility Functions Overview

The Utility Functions section describes useful functions that the SDK Libraries make available to a TrickPlay application.

Included are debugging functions, such as <print>, <dumptable> and <reload>. An application can process Lua source code and import data from external files with the <dofile>, <loadfile> and <readfile> functions. 

Functions are also provided to encode data in various manners, including encryption using the MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashing algorithms (the <md5>, <sha1> and <sha256> functions, respectively), and Base64 conversions are accomplished with <base64_encode> and <base64_decode>. Regular expressions are supported in <regex_replace>, and strings can be parsed and tokenized using <split>.

Many other useful functions are provided. Scan the <Utility Functions> Summary section to see the complete list.
