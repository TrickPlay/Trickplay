Title: The Engine Console

	When the TrickPlay Engine is run in a development environment, the Console is available for performing various operations, including--

		(table)
		-- Display status and debug messages
		-- Enter and execute Lua code statements
		-- Invoke Console commands to control a running TrickPlay application
		-- Perform the above tasks remotely via a Telnet connection
		(end)
		
	As the TrickPlay Engine initializes and executes, it displays status and debug messages on the Console. An application can output its own messages to the Console by executing a standard Lua print() statement.
	
	The Console is also a full Lua interpreter, so Lua code statements can be entered at the Console's command prompt, and they will be executed immediately.

	Console commands to control a running TrickPlay application are entered manually at the Console's command prompt or specified on the Engine's command line. Commands are always preceded by a slash character. The Console recognizes the following commands.

		/config - Display configuration information about the Engine.
		/exit - Terminate any running TrickPlay application and exit the Console. Pressing the <Esc> key has the same result.
		/gc - Schedule a garbage collection operation. Note: The operation may not occur immediately.
		/images - List information about existing Image objects in a running TrickPlay application.
		/obj - List information about all existing objects in a running TrickPlay application.
		/prof - Display profiling information for a running TrickPlay application.
		/profile - List the current profile ID, name and PIN. A default profile is always available if one is not set explicitly. When a TrickPlay application saves its settings, it saves them under the current profile. Also, when a TrickPlay application is installed, the Engine associates the application with the current profile, which enables different applications to be accessible from different profiles.
		/profile new <name> - Create a new profile with a profile name of <name>. The profile ID is output to the Console when the new profile is created. Specify this ID with the /profile switch command to change to the profile.
		/profile switch <id> - Set the current profile to the profile with an ID of <id>.
		/reload - Clear the current TrickPlay application from the Engine and reload and run a fresh instance.
		/ss - Create a screen shot of the running TrickPlay application. The file is saved in the user's home directory using a filename of trickplay-ss-nnn.png, where nnn is a unique numeric sequence.
		/ui [gid || actorName] - Display information about all user-interface objects in a running TrickPlay application. If the optional gid or actorName is specified then the displayed information is limited to the referenced object.
		/ver - Display version information for the Engine and Engine libraries.

	The Console can be controlled remotely via a Telnet connection. The default Telnet port is 7777, but the port number can be changed by setting the console_port configuration key. Refer to the <TrickPlay Configuration Keys> section of the Programmer's Guide for further details.
