    Topic: All states
    
    Calls that can be made in any state and never change state.

        TrickPlay can always call:
        
            - <TPMediaPlayer.get_viewport_geometry>
            - <TPMediaPlayer.set_viewport_geometry>
            - <TPMediaPlayer.get_audio_volume>

            - <TPMediaPlayer.set_audio_mute>
            
        Media player can always call:
        
            - <tp_media_player_get_state>:
    
    
    Topic: IDLE state
    
    The initial state of all media players. In this state, the media player
    should hold minimal resources.
    
        TrickPlay can call:
        
            - <TPMediaPlayer.load>:            
                Returns zero, goes to <LOADING state>.

            - <TPMediaPlayer.destroy>:
                Does not change state.
                            
        Media player can call:
        
            - Nothing.
            
    Topic: LOADING state
    
    The media player is attempting to load a resource.
    
        TrickPlay can call:
        
            - <TPMediaPlayer.reset>:
                Goes to <IDLE state> and drops all knowledge of the resource.
            
        Media player can call:

                Does not change state.

    Topic: PAUSED state
    
    The media player is paused and ready to play.
    
        TrickPlay can call:
        
            - <TPMediaPlayer.play>:
                Returns zero, goes to <PLAYING state>.
