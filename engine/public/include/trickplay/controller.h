    File: Controller
    
    A controller is mostly an input device, but this specification also supports
    some output features. It can be as simple as a remote control, keyboard or
    mouse, or as complex as a touch screen device that supports custom user
    interface elements and has an accelerometer.
    
    Controllers can be added and removed at any time; all of these functions are
    thread safe.
    
    You begin by creating a <TPControllerSpec> structure that describes the
    capabilities of the controller. You can also provide a callback to allow
    TrickPlay to execute controller commands; such as displaying a user interface
    or playing sounds.
    
    You then pass that structure to <tp_context_add_controller> along with a name
    for the controller and optional user data. <tp_context_add_controller> returns
    a pointer to a controller structure. You can then call the <Controller Events>
    functions with that pointer. Finally, if the device is disconnected, you can
    call <tp_context_remove_controller>. If the device will always remain connected,
    it is not necessary to call <tp_context_remove_controller>, as TrickPlay will
    dispose of the controller when it exits.

    Constants: Capabilities
    
    These constants can be ORed together and assigned to <TPControllerSpec.capabilities>.

                                        key events.          
    
    TP_CONTROLLER_HAS_ACCELEROMETER   - The controller is capable of sending
                                        accelerometer events.

    TP_CONTROLLER_HAS_POINTER_CURSOR  - The controller draws a pointer cursor on the screen.
                                        
    TP_CONTROLLER_HAS_SCROLL		  - The controller has a scroll-wheel-like device.

    TP_CONTROLLER_HAS_TOUCHES         - The controller supports touches, or swipes
                                        and can send their x and y coordinates.
                                        
    TP_CONTROLLER_HAS_MULTIPLE_CHOICE - The controller is capable of rendering

                                        user with a handful of choices and can
                                        notify TrickPlay when the user makes a
                                        selection.

                                        sent by TrickPlay. This can be via an on

    sends the controller a 'resource name' which is a simple string used to
    refer to the resource as well as a URI to the resource. The URI could be

    Section: Controller Event Queries

    These functions let you know whether a controller wants certain types of events.
    They are a convenience; so you don't have to keep track of the related start
    and stop commands.

    For example, a controller will want accelerometer events only if a) it has
    TP_CONTROLLER_HAS_ACCELEROMETER in its capabilities and b) the result of
    execute_command with TP_CONTROLLER_COMMAND_START_ACCELEROMETER was zero (success).

    You don't have to check these functions when you invoke the related event
    callbacks; they are checked automatically for you. For example, if you call
    tp_controller_accelerometer, and the controller does not want accelerometer
    events, the call is ignored.

    Arguments:
    
        context -   A pointer to the associated TrickPlay context.
        
        name -      A NULL terminated name for the controller. This should be
