/***************************************
    Class: Canvas

    The Canvas data type provides an in-memory vector-based drawing surface. Various drawing tools and operations are supported.

    The Canvas class uses the <Cairo Vector Graphics library at http://www.cairographics.org>, but you do not need to understand that library before using the Canvas class. The basic information necessary to create and manipulate a Canvas object is described in this documentation. If you desire additional information about Cairo, refer to the <Cairo documentation at http://www.cairographics.org/documentation>.

    This short introduction will acquaint you with Canvas concepts, the drawing tools, and supported operations. Detailed information describing each Canvas property and function follows this introduction. An additional code example is described in the <Canvas Sample Application> section.

    *Making a Line, Drawing a Shape*

    A Canvas object contains a two-dimensional drawing surface. The size of the drawing surface is specified in pixels when the Canvas is created. All visible drawing operations are performed upon the drawing surface, and, for this reason, the drawing surface is sometimes referred to as the "destination."

    Similar to real-life drawing when you move a pencil along paper, drawing on a Canvas is performed by moving a point along a path on the drawing surface. You define the path with functions such as <move_to> and <line_to>. You can also specify characteristics of the drawn line, such as the <line_width> and its color (see the <set_source_color> function). Lines can be solid or dashed, joined in various manners, and end in different shapes (see the <set_dash> function and the <line_join> and <line_cap> properties).

    In addition to drawing lines, the Canvas object provides functions to create simple shapes, such as rectangles, circles, and Bezier curves (see the <rectangle>, <arc> and <curve_to> functions). Text can be drawn onto the Canvas surface by using the <text_path> function.

    *Stroking the Line, Filling the Shape*

    Unlike a visible line drawn with a real pencil, the drawn path is initially invisible. Various methods are provided to make the line visible, and the method chosen will depend upon the shape you've defined and how you want the line or shape to look. For example, if you have created a simple flat line, you can make the line visible on the drawing surface by calling the <stroke> function. If your path defines a closed shape, like a rectangle or circle, you can also use the stroke function to draw the outline of the shape. If you want to color the inside of the shape, you can call the <fill> function. If you want to draw both the outline and color the shape, you can call both functions, stroke() and fill(), along the same path.

    Besides drawing with solid colors, shapes can be filled with linear or radial gradient patterns that shift from one color to another (see the <set_source_linear_pattern> and <set_source_radial_pattern> functions). Support is also provided to fill shapes using an image in a <Bitmap> object.

    *Bending the Line, Distorting the Shape*

    An existing path can be manipulated in various ways. For example, it can be rotated to spin it around (see the <rotate> function). It can be scaled to alter its size or stretch it in different directions (the <scale> function). Part of the path can be clipped so a section of it will not be visible (see the <clip> function).

    Multiple shapes that overlap can be combined in different ways to create new shapes. In the simplest instance, two overlapping shapes can perform a simple union to form a single shape. Or two shapes can be combined so that only their overlapping area is retained. And when shapes are combined, not only their outlines, but also their colors and transparency settings can be combined in various ways. Refer to the <op> property for further information.

	Finally, after your Canvas is completely drawn and is ready to be displayed on the screen, you can convert the drawing surface to an <Image>. (Canvas objects cannot be displayed directly; they must first be converted to Image objects.)

	*A Three-Layer Canvas Cake*

    If you read other Cairo documentation besides this document, they often refer to the path as the "mask." The mask can be thought of as a layer floating above the Canvas drawing surface/destination.

    There is also a third layer that floats above the path/mask and is called the "source." The source is the color or pattern used to stroke or fill the path/mask.

    It can be helpful to visualize these three layers as being of the same size, one above the other, with the drawing surface on the bottom, the path/mask in the middle, and the source on top.

    (see canvasLayers.png)

    Imagine that the defined path is cut from the path/mask layer, just as if you had used scissors to cut a shape from the middle of a piece of paper. For example, if you want to fill a circle shape, the circle is cut out from the path/mask layer. Then, when you make a path/mask visible on the drawing surface by calling fill(), think of the three layers pressing upon each other. The cut portion of the path/mask enables the source color/pattern to touch the destination, thus transferring the source to the drawing surface.

    Depending upon what you attempt to draw, it's possible for things to get complicated. If you keep in mind, however, that everything is based on manipulating these three layers, you should be able to keep things under control.

	With this foundation, you are prepared to read through and understand the various Canvas properties and functions.

        Constructor: Canvas

        The Canvas constructor creates an empty and transparent in-memory drawing surface. Each pixel on the surface contains a Red, a Green, and a Blue color component and an Alpha transparency value.

		*Prototype:*

		(code)
		Canvas( width, height )
		(end)

        *Arguments:*

        width - width of the Canvas drawing surface in pixels
        height - height of the Canvas drawing surface in pixels

        *Return Value:*

        canvas - a Canvas object whose drawing surface is empty and completely transparent. If insufficient memory exists to create the Canvas object, a Canvas object is still returned, but you will not be able to perform any operations with it. After creating a Canvas object, check the <ok> property to verify that a valid object exists.

    /*
        Property: fill_rule

        The fill_rule property is a string that specifies the method used to determine which regions of a path are inside the path (and therefore filled) and which regions are outside (and not filled). The fill_rule becomes important when shapes overlap or are completely enclosed within other shapes or when the path intersects itself and thereby creates closed regions within the shape.

        The fill_rule affects the fill() and clip() operations only.

        *Supported Settings:* The fill_rule setting is case-sensitive.

        "EVEN_ODD" - an area inside an even number of enclosed areas is not-filled; an area inside an odd number of enclosed areas is filled. See the discussion below for more details.
        "WINDING" - takes into account the path's direction; creating the same path in an opposite direction can reverse which regions are filled and which are left hollow. See the discussion below for more details. Also known as "Non-Zero Winding" fill rule.

        *Default Setting:* WINDING

        The Even-Odd fill rule counts the number of regions that a particular region is enclosed within. Areas enclosed within an even number of regions are left unfilled; areas enclosed within an odd number of regions are filled. Let's look at some examples.

        We'll start with the simplest scenario: a single circle. The circle is enclosed within one region: itself. Odd-numbered regions are filled, so the one-region circle is filled.

        A circle with another circle contained within it is also easy to visualize. The outermost circle is contained only within itself: 1 region. The inner circle is contained within itself and the outer circle: 2 regions. Thus, the even-numbered inner circle is left hollow, while the portion of the odd-numbered outer circle not overlapped by the inner circle is filled. This scenario can be repeated with infinitely smaller circles.

        (see canvasFillRuleEOSimpleCircles.png)

        Two overlapping circles present another possibility. The non-overlapping sections of each circle are contained within themselves: 1 region each. The overlapping area is contained in two regions. Thus, the odd-numbered non-overlapping regions are filled, and the even-numbered overlapping region is left hollow.

        (see canvasFillRuleEOOverlappingCircles.png)

        Let's enclose our two overlapping circles within a rectangle. The rectangle is contained within itself: 1 region. The non-overlapping portions of the circles are contained within themselves and the rectangle: 2 regions. The circle's overlapping area is contained within the two circles and the rectangle: 3 regions. The odd-numbered/filled and even-numbered/unfilled fill rule is then applied.

        (see canvasFillRuleEOCirclesInRect.png)

        The Non-Zero Winding fill rule determines whether or not to fill a region based on the direction of the paths used to enclose the region. A path moving clockwise is assigned a value of +1. A region enclosed by a counter-clockwise path is given a value of -1. Depending on the path, a region may be made up of some segments moving clockwise and other segments moving counter-clockwise. All the paths making up the region are added together. Regions with a non-zero total are filled; those with a sum of zero are not filled. This can get complicated and confusing, so let's look at some simple examples to begin.

        The simplest scenario is our friendly single circle. If its path direction is clockwise, its total is +1, so it is filled. If its path direction is counter-clockwise, its total is -1, so it is still filled. In this case, the path's direction makes no difference.

        (see canvasFillRuleWSimpleCircles.png)

        What about the case of a small circle completely enclosed within a larger circle? Now the path directions become important and will determine whether a circle is filled or not. In the case of the large, outer circle, its total will be either +1 or -1, depending on its path direction. Thus, the region of the outer circle that is *not* shared with the inner circle is always non-zero, and thus is always filled. For the moment, let's assume the outer circle path moves clockwise, so its total is +1, and let's look at the inner circle. If the inner circle's path moves in the same clockwise direction, its value is also +1 for a total of 1 + 1, or 2. Thus, the inner circle will be filled, as well. If the inner circle path moves in the opposite counter-clockwise direction, its value is -1, so its total becomes (+1) + (-1), or 0. Now it will *not* be filled.

        (see canvasFillRuleWCircleInCircle.png)

		All shapes, not just circles, are filled by totaling the path-direction values of its own shape, plus any outer shapes that contain it. Let's look at one more example of completely-enclosed shapes before moving on. Let's say there are three rectangles: an outer, a middle, and an inner. The path of the outer rectangle moves clockwise, so it is filled. The path of the middle rectangle moves in the same clockwise direction, so it is filled, too. The path of the inner rectangle moves in the opposite counter-clockwise direction, so it is not filled, right? Wrong! The total of the inner rectangle is the sum of all three rectangles, or (+1) + (+1) + (-1) = +1, so the inner rectangle is filled, too. You have to do the addition for each enclosing shape to determine whether or not a particular shape will be filled.

		(see canvasFillRuleWRectangles.png)

		As shapes become more complicated, the calculations become more complicated, too. Let's consider two overlapping circles. In the first scenario, both circle paths will move in the same direction, say clockwise. The non-overlapping portions will have a total of +1, so they will be filled. The overlapping region calculates its total by adding the values of both circles so the region's total is 1 + 1 = 2; thus, the overlapping region is filled. What if the two circles move in opposite directions? Again, the non-overlapping regions have non-zero totals (+1 and -1), so they are filled. But now the total for the overlapping region is the sum of +1 and -1 for a total of 0, so in this case the overlapping region is not filled.

		(see canvasFillRuleWOverlappingCircles.png)

		Hang onto your seat, and let's put the two overlapping circles into an enclosing rectangle. We'll just evaluate one scenario, but you can work out all the various possibilities yourself, if you want. Let's say the rectangle moves clockwise and the two circles both move counter-clockwise. The rectangle has a value of +1, so it is filled. The non-overlapping regions of the circles each have values of (-1) and, when combined with the enclosing rectangle, totals (-1) + 1 = 0, so they are not filled. The overlapped region of the circles consists of both circles plus the rectangle ((-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1); its non-zero total means the circle's overlapping region is filled.

		(see canvasFillRuleWCirclesInRect.png)

		You may have noticed that this circles-in-a-rectangle shape using the Non-Zero Winding rule was filled in the exact same way earlier using the Even-Odd filling rule. This occurred, however, only because of the shapes' path directions in this particular scenario. If you change the path direction of the rectangle or one or both circles, the filled areas will change, too. With the Non-Zero Winding rule, you have more available possibilities to manipulate which areas are filled and which are left hollow.

		With this foundation, you should be able to work out for yourself other complicated overlapping shapes. For example, calculate the filled and non-filled regions of three overlapping circles shown below using the Even-Odd and Non-Zero Winding rules. Use various path directions with the Winding rule to see which filled areas change as the directions change. Some filled areas have already been started for you because in both fill rules, the outer, non-overlapping regions will always be filled.

        *Code Example:* Define a star shape using intersecting lines that also creates an enclosed internal region. Fill the shape using different fill_rule settings.

        -- Create a Canvas object
        canvas = Canvas( 1920, 1080 )
        canvas:set_source_color( "ffffffFF" )

        -- Draw a star with intersecting lines

        canvas:close_path()

        -- Draw the lines, saving the path
        canvas:stroke( true )

        -- Set the fill rule
        canvas.fill_rule = "WINDING"

        -- Fill the shape, using a fill color
        -- The resulting internal shape has five line segments, each going in the
        -- same clockwise direction for a total of +5, thus it is filled.
        canvas:set_source_color( "ff0000FF" )
        canvas:fill()

        -- Draw the same shape in another location
        canvas:move_to( 400, 170 )

        canvas:close_path()

        -- Draw the lines, saving the path
        canvas:set_source_color( "ffffffFF" )
        canvas:stroke( true )

        -- Set the fill rule
        canvas.fill_rule = "EVEN_ODD"

        -- Fill the shape, using a fill color
        -- In this case, the resulting internal shape is contained within itself and
        -- the outer star shape for an even-numbered total of 2, thus it is not filled.

    /*
        Property: filter

        The filter property is a text string specifying the filter type used when interpolating pixels in a pattern. Pixel interpolation occurs when a pattern is resized or remapped on the drawing surface, such as when a pattern is scaled or rotated. Image quality can suffer when pixels are added or lost (as occurs during resizing and scaling) or when pixels shift positions (as during rotation). Interpolation is an attempt to determine the best approximation of a pixel's color and transparency based upon its surrounding pixels. Getting an accurate approximation can especially affect the quality of a pattern's edges.

		*Possible Settings:* The filter property is case-sensitive.

        "FAST" - a high-performance filter, similar in quality to "NEAREST"
        "GOOD" - a reasonable-performance filter, similar in quality to "BILINEAR"
        "BEST" - the highest-quality filter; may not be suitable for interactive use
        "NEAREST" - a nearest-neighbor filter. Each interpolated pixel looks only at the closest corresponding pixel in the original pattern to determine the interpolated pixel's value.
        "BILINEAR" - a bilinear filter. Each interpolated pixel looks at a 2x2 region of surrounding pixels in the original pattern to determine the interpolated pixel's value. This results in more accurate interpolations than nearest-neighbor, but requires more time to accomplish.

        *Default Setting:* "GOOD"

        *See Also:* the <antialias> property

        The line_cap property is a string that specifies the type of path-ends to render when performing a stroke operation.

        The line_cap property is used only by the Canvas <stroke> function.

        *Supported Settings:* The line_cap setting is case-sensitive.

        "BUTT" - start and stop the line at the path's exact end points
        "ROUND" - use a rounded end; the path's end points specify the center of the circle
        "SQUARE" - use a squared end; the path's end points specify the center of the square

        *Default Setting:* "BUTT"

        Notice that the "ROUND" and "SQUARE" settings add a rounded or squared end to each endpoint of the path. This will cause the generated line to extend slightly beyond the path's specified endpoints. The extra distance added to each endpoint is determined by the line's width specified in the Canvas object's line_width property. Specifically, each endpoint is extended line_width/2 pixels, i.e., line_width pixels for the entire line.

		The dash pattern is used only by the Canvas <stroke> function.

		To clear a dash pattern and return to a solid line, use the <clear_dash> function.

		*Arguments:*

		offset - number of leading empty pixels before first dash begins
		dashes - table of positive double values that define the dash pattern. Each value specifies the length in pixels for alternating ON and OFF portions of the line. If the dashes table contains a single value then a symmetric pattern of equal ON and OFF lengths is generated, and the single value specifies the segment length. The table may contain the value 0, but all values in the table cannot be 0.

		*Default Setting:* Dashes are disabled.

		*Return Value:* Boolean value indicating the success or failure of the operation. If an invalid dash pattern is specified, returns false, and the previous dash pattern remains in effect. Otherwise, returns true.

		*Code Example:* Create some sample dashed lines

        Multiple origin shifts can be accumulated and combined to form what is called a "transformation matrix." For example, the following transformation operations can be invoked to create a matrix.

        - Create a rectangle at coordinate (0,0) and fill it   ; rectangle is created in top-left corner of drawing surface
        - translate( 100, 100 )   ; drawing surface origin shifts to (100, 100)
        - Create another rectangle at (0, 0) and fill it   ; rectangle is created at (0, 0) top-left corner of *translated* drawing surface. Actual untranslated coordinate is (100, 100).
        - translate( 400, 400 )   ; drawing surface origin shifts to (400, 400) of *previous* shifted origin. Actual untranslated coordinate origin is (500, 500).
        - Create third rectangle at (0, 0) and fill it   ; rectangle is created at (0, 0) top-left corner of *translated* drawing surface. Actual untranslated coordinate is (500, 500).
        - translate( -100, -100)   ; drawing surface origin shifts up and left of previous shifted origin. Actual untranslated coordinate origin is now (400, 400).
        - Create fourth rectangle at (0, 0) and fill it   ; rectangle is created at (0, 0) top-left corner of translated drawing surface. Actual untranslated coordinate is (400, 400).

        Coordinate translation is only one of several transformation operations that can make up a matrix.

        As part of its operation, the push_group() function saves the current drawing context by calling the <save> function. Similarly, when drawing is complete, the pop_group() function restores the original context by calling <restore>. Thus, transformations, such as scaling and rotating, performed on the intermediate surface will not affect previous drawing contexts after they are popped.

        One use of push_group()/pop_group() is to generate composite images that are subsequently used in fade-out transitions. In such a situation, all the components of the desired pattern are drawn on the intermediate surface. For example, the surface can be initially filled with a color or pattern, and then subsequent drawn strokes can be placed on top of the fill. The generated popped pattern is a flat, non-layered image that is gradually made transparent during the fade-out. Because the pattern is a flat image without layers, it fades evenly. If, instead, the fading image had been composed of individual layered components, such as stroked lines sitting on top of a fill pattern, as each upper layer becomes slowly transparent, the layers beneath it become partially visible, producing a potentially undesirable effect.

        The line_to() function adds a straight line to the path from the current point to the X and Y coordinates specified in the function's arguments. The function's X, Y coordinates then become the new current point. The path's starting point is typically set by the <move_to> function.

        *Arguments:*

        x - double value specifying the ending X coordinate
        y - double value specifying the ending Y coordinate
        relative - boolean value indicating whether or not the specified coordinates are relative to the path's starting point. Default value is false, i.e., the coordinates are absolute to the drawing surface.

        A rectangle with rounded corners can also be generated by setting the <line_join> property to "ROUND" and calling the <rectangle> function.

        The text_path() function adds specified text to the current path. The text is positioned with its top-left corner at the path's current point. If the path has no current point, the text is positioned at coordinates (0, 0).

        The text's font family, style and point size can also be specified. All the font information is contained within a text string in the function's font argument.

        The text can be a simple string or it can contain HTML-like formatting instructions. This formatting capability is provided by the Pango Text Attribute Markup language. Refer to the <Pango documentation at http://developer.gnome.org/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html> for complete details on the supported syntax.

        The resulting text path can be manipulated like any other item on the drawing surface; it can be scaled, rotated or have any other transformation performed upon it. To draw the text path, call the usual <stroke> or <fill> functions. The stroke() function draws the text's outlines; the fill() function fills the text outlines. This is demonstrated in the code example below.

        *Arguments:*

        font - string describing the font family, style and point size. The string's format and supported settings are described in the <Text.font> documentation.
        text - string containing the text to add to the path. If the markup argument is true, this string may include Pango Text Attribute Markup formatting instructions.
        markup - boolean flag indicating whether or not the text argument contains Pango Text Attribute Markup instructions. Default is true, i.e., the text argument does contain Pango Markup instructions. Note: Setting this argument to true with a text string that does not have Pango Markup instructions has no harmful effect.

        *Return Value:* None

        *Code Example:* Add some text to the path. Draw the text with stroke() and fill() to view the difference.

The coordinate values can be separated by spaces or a comma.

		*Supported Node Types:*

		M, m - adds a move_to-type node. Requires one X,Y coordinate. This is equivalent to calling the Canvas <move_to> function. A new subpath is started and the current point is moved to the specified X,Y.
		L, l - adds a line_to-type node. Requires one X,Y coordinate. This is equivalent to calling the Canvas <line_to> function.
		C, c - adds a curve_to-type node. Requires three X,Y coordinates in the following order: FirstControlPoint, SecondControlPoint, EndPoint. This is equivalent to calling the Canvas <curve_to> function.

        The (x1, y1) point defines the gradient's start position, and the (x2, y2) point defines its end position. The rate at which the grandient occurs is definable by specifying "color stops" at various points along the gradient line. Each color stop specifies the gradient color at that location on the gradient line. The colors of intermediate points are calculated at the time the pattern is realized by the stroke() or fill() function. Color stops are defined by calling the <add_source_pattern_color_stop> function. By defining color stops, a gradient can occur evenly along the entire length of the line, or unevenly with more of the gradient change occuring at one end of the line.

        *Arguments:*

        x1, y1 - coordinates for start of gradient line
        x2, y2 - coordinates for end of gradient line

        *Return Value:* None

        *Code Example:* Fill rectangles with a vertical and horizontal linear gradient pattern

        Function: set_source_radial_pattern

        The set_source_radial_pattern() function sets subsequent drawing operations to a radial gradient pattern between the two circles specified by the (cx0, cy0, radius0) and (cx1, cy1, radius1) arguments.

        The (cx0, cy0, radius0) values define the gradient's start circle, and the (cx1, cy1, radius1) values define the gradient's end circle. The gradient moves from one point on the start circle to the corresponding point on the end circle.  The rate at which the grandient occurs is definable by specifying "color stops" at various points along the gradient circle. Each color stop specifies the gradient color at that location on the gradient circle. The colors of intermediate points are calculated at the time the pattern is realized by the stroke() or fill() function. Color stops are defined by calling the <add_source_pattern_color_stop> function. By defining color stops, a gradient can occur evenly along the entire length of the circle, or unevenly with more of the gradient change occuring at one end of the circle.

        *Arguments:*

        cx0, cy0 - coordinates for center of start circle
        radius0 - radius of start circle
        cx1, cy1 - coordinates for center of end circle
