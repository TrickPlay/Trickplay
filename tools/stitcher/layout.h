#ifndef __LAYOUT_H__

/*

layout.h

Layout uses a deterministic space-partitioning algorithm to arrange items from a State in a minimally wasteful manner. The space begins as one Leaf partition, and the highest-sorted Item in placed in its top-left corner, dividing the remaining space into two Leaf partitions. This repeats for each Item in the State:
    - select the Leaf that best matches the shape of the current Item and packs the tightest
    - place the Item
    - subdivide the remaining space

If the maximum textures size (-t) is too small to hold all the Items in one Layout, some items may be excluded and need to be processed into second or third Layouts.
