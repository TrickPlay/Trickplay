This app does a bunch of animations - when you press a key. It shows that 
sometimes a weak ref to one of our user datas can be removed from the weak
ref table before the user data is finalized (which is something that Lua
does).

This was causing an assertion when a user data in this state got a toggle
ref notify and tried to go from weak to strong. When dereferencing the 
weak ref, it got a nil.
