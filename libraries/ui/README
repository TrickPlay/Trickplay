Understanding the Folder / File Layout

    - main.lua & app file: 
        These files merely exist for testing purposes, they also are
        necessary in order to use the Visual Debugger (which assumes
        that you are working on an app)
    
    - Widget_Library.lua: 
        In order to use this library, the developed must include the line:
            WL = dofile("Widget_Library.lua")
        "WL" can be any variable name, the dofile/loadfile returns a table 
        that contains all of the widget constructors and other globals 
        created by the library
        This file performs a lazy loading of all widgets.
    
    - load_json.lua: 
        contains the code tha the visual editor uses to load stored "Layers," 
        which are saved as jsons
    
    - __UTILITIES/*.lua : 
        creates functions that are used by all the widgets
    
    - __CORE/*.lua : 
        creates the base Widget, Style, and ColorScheme Class as
    
    - */* :
        There is one folder per widget. Each folder is the widget's name. 
        Each folder contains a file with the same name, which contains the 
        constructor for that widget. Each file also contains a "test.lua"
        file which contains an example of how to create that widget.
